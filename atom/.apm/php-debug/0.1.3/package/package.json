Check the results of the [phpinfo function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php) for xdebug informtation.  \nIf no xdebug section exists, you likely need to install this. *nix users can likely find it within their package manager of choice.  \nAlternative installation or compiling instructions are available [here](http://xdebug.org/docs/install).\n\n## Setting up Xdebug ##\n\n```\nxdebug.remote_enable=1\nxdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1\nxdebug.remote_connect_back=1    # Not safe for production servers\nxdebug.remote_port=9000\nxdebug.remote_handler=dbgp\nxdebug.remote_mode=req\nxdebug.remote_autostart=true\n```\n\nWith these settings, PHP will connect to your editor for every script it executes.  \nThe alternative is to switch xdebug.remote_autostart to false, and install an Xdebug helper extension for your browser of choice, such as:\n - [The easiest Xdebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-easiest-xdebug/) for Mozilla Firefox\n - [Xdebug Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) for Google Chrome\n\nThese browser extensions will give you a button within your browser to enable/disable Xdebug.  \nIt is also possible to run a php script from the command line with Xdebug enabled.  \nYou can find more information on this at the Xdebug documentation for [Starting The Debugger](http://xdebug.org/docs/remote#starting).  \nSee can find a complete list and explanation of Xdebug settings [here](http://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings).\n\n## Start Debugging ##\n\nTo begin debugging:  \n1. Open up your PHP file in atom  \n2. Move the cursor to a line you want to break on, and set a breakpoint by pressing ctrl+f9 or selecting Toggle Breakpoint from the Command Palette (ctrl+shift+p) or the php-debug menu (Packages -> php-debug->Toggle Breakpoint). This will highlight the line number green, to indicate the presence of a breakpoint.  \n3. Open up the debug view by pressing ctrl+alt+d, or selecting 'Toggle Debugging' from the Command Palette or php-debug menu.  \n4. Start the script with Xdebug enabled. If everything is setup correctly, the entire line of the breakpoint will be highlighted in green, indicating the current line of the script.\n\nIf everything worked correctly, you can now use the various buttons/commands to step through the script.\n\n# Settings\n\nPut the following in your config.cson\n```cson\n\"php-debug\":\n  {\n    ServerPort: 9000\n    PathMaps: [\n      {\n        local: \"C:\\\\base\\\\path\\\\on\\\\local\\\\system\"\n        remote: \"/base/path/on/remote/system\"\n      },\n      {\n        local: \"C:\\\\another\\\\path\\\\map\"\n        remote: \"/home/yay/\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Server Port ###\nThis is the port that the atom client will listen on.\nDefaults to 9000\n\n### Path Maps ###\nIf debugging code that resides on a remote machine, use pathmaps to map a path\non the remote machine to a path on the local machine.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gwomacks/php-debug/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gwomacks/php-debug#readme","_id":"php-debug@0.1.3","_shasum":"d2abd31a74bf005d98246c7c2fde45a472cc9eda","_resolved":"file:../d-11596-2805-3p1ujz/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11596-2805-3p1ujz/package.tgz"}
