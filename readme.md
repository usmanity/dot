About
---------

This repo contains some settings files and a `setup.sh` file which helps
copy over the files and download the Hack font.

You can use this as an example repo to see some settings.

I often like to clean up this repo so files might be unavailable at times.  

Todo
----
- [ ] Default git settings (simple committing)
- [ ] Add better handling of environment variables based on directory (like nvmrc)
- [ ] Fix issues where git won't know who the author is when committing
