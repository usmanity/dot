About
---------

This repo contains some settings files and a `setup.sh` file which helps
copy over the files and download the Hack font.

Below are some things that are done and some things left to do for this to be usable for myself.

You can use this as an example repo to see some settings, I often like
to clean up this repo so files might be unavailable at times.  

*Oceanic* theme is not owned by me, you can find it here: https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes
