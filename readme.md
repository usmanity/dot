About
---------

This repo contains some settings files and a `setup.sh` file which helps
copy over the files and download the Hack font.

You can use this as an example repo to see some settings.

I often like to clean up this repo so files might be unavailable at times.

Tools used
----------

Maybe you'd like to try some of the tools I install along with my dot folder setup:

- [autojump `j`](https://github.com/wting/autojump) -> instead of using `cd` to go to directories I'm always moving between, autojump lets you quickly move between directories.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) -> pretty prints JSON. Recently, I've also started using [jsonui](https://github.com/gulyasm/jsonui).
- [silver search `ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) -> quickest search program I've found. It's like grep but works better for me.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) -> similar to `find` but easier to use.
