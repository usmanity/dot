About
---------

This repo contains some settings files and a `setup.sh` file which helps
copy over the files and download the Hack font.

Below are some things that are done and some things left to do for this to be usable for myself.

You can use this as an example repo to see some settings, I often like
to clean up this repo so files might be unavailable at times.  

*Oceanic* theme is not owned by me, you can find it here: https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes

Done
----

- [x] Create vimrc file
- [x] Install hack (if found)
- [x] Copy over oh-my-zsh so that it's easier to get started, I opted for using a simple ZSH setup instead of a full oh-my-zsh setup.  
- [x] Add correct permissions for copied over files

Todo
----
- [ ] Default git settings (simple committing)
